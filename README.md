# Common

### A collection of commonly used classes

I didn't want to import big libraries and packages<br/>
The intention is to keep my apps as slim and as close to clean php as possible<br/>
I got the idea from Zak Horton's [Slim 4 Authorization Tutorial ](https://github.com/zhorton34/authorize-slim-4) to create my own.<br/>

This package is part of a series of packages to create a modular skeleton ap for fast, lightweight simple application development<br/>
I wanted a self maintened "micro framework"<br/>

This series of repos also contains a mash of mixed ideas for classes, methods and aproaches I liked from [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel) and [Yii2](https://github.com/yiisoft).<br/>

It is free to use and modify as you see fit.<br/>
I recomend forking it because it's purpose is for personal use and I will only maintain it as long as I find it useful for myself.
